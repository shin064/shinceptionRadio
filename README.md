## Sub-Heading ##
  Radio player for the slightly lazy.

## Summary ##
  This product is for the "slightly lazy". NPR One is a popular app for very lazy people, since a user does not have to do anything to start listening. Once the app starts, it starts playing stories. In contrast, Shinception Rad.io allows you to set up your favorite shows, so it works just like NPR One, except that all the stories that the player selects to play automatically are chosen from your pre-selected shows list.

## Problem ##
  Most podcast apps require the user to constantly choose specifically what episode they want to listen to. On the other extreme, an app like NPR One does not allow any customization.

## Solution ##
  Shinception Rad.io takes out the work on the user of having to select what episode they want to listen to every time one episode finishes. The user can simply select their favorite shows in the beginning, and let the player do the work of selecting an episode to play from the assortment of the user's pre-selected favorite shows.
